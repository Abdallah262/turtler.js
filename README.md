# JS Turtle

## Background 
[Turtle graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics) are vector graphics using a relative cursor (the "turtle") upon a Cartesian plane (x and y axis). 

This program is an environment to learn/teach programming with JavaScript language. Idea initialy comes from [Seymour Papert](http://www.papert.org/). Javascript version of turtle graphycs initialy started by  [bjpop](https://github.com/bjpop), than forked and developed and documented by [hanumanum](https://github.com/hanumanum). This version has been further modified by (philbowman)[https://github.com/philbowman]. [GitHub Repository is here](https://github.com/cs-acs/js-turtle).

The __turtle__ can move about the plane and has a few __attributes__: *location (x,y coordinates)*, *direction (angle the turtle is pointing)*, and *pen*.  

The __pen__ also has attributes: *color*, *width*, and *up/down state* (whether the pen will make a mark or not). Imagine a robot on wheels with a pen it can lift up and down.
